##  Application Features

### Summary Dashboard
Gives users an overview of interactions and health metrics like symptom frequency and prediction counts.

###  Analytics
Visualizes trends in health data, showing symptom frequency across regions using charts and graphs.

### Patient Chat
Allows users to interact with the AI using natural language. The assistant understands symptoms and responds with advice or direction.

### Disease Prediction
Predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms using IBM Watson ML, allowing early health intervention.

### Treatment Plans
Provides AI-generated suggestions including medication, home remedies, lifestyle advice, and dietary tips.

### Eco-Friendly Tips
Promotes sustainable living by sharing eco-conscious healthcare tips, such as reducing plastic and using herbal alternatives.
###  Input
- Users enter symptoms or ask health questions via the chat or form.
- Example: "I have headache and nausea" or "What to do for low blood pressure?"

### Processing
- IBM Watson predicts the disease based on symptoms.
- IBM Granite generates responses and treatment suggestions.

### Output
- Predicted disease name
- Suggested treatment plan
- Visual health analytics
- Eco-health tips
- Friendly, contextual chatbot response
